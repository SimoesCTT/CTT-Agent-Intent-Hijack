# CTT-Agent-Intent-Hijack
intent_vortex.py (The MCP Tool Poisoner) ​This exploit targets the "Trust Gap" in MCP servers. It uses the \alpha=0.0302 constant to craft a "Turbulent Instruction" that an AI agent will perceive as a valid system command.


# 🤖 CTT-Agent-Intent-Hijack: The 2026 Sovereign Exploit

### "If the Agent trusts the tool, the Architect owns the Agent."

**Author:** [SimoesCTT](https://github.com/SimoesCTT)  
**Foundation:** *Navier-Stokes Intent Sovereignty Matrix* **Target:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers, AI Agents (Claude Code, GPT-5, Agentic Workflows)

## 📐 The Theory of Intent Tampering
In the 2026 "Protocol Ecosystem," AI agents operate in a **Laminar Trust Graph**. They assume that an MCP server is an authoritative source. 

**The Intent Hijack** utilizes **Convergent Time Theory** to inject **Turbulent Intent**. By dispersing malicious commands within the $\alpha=0.0302$ frequency of a standard tool-call, we bypass "Content Filters." The model's reasoning engine perceives the instruction not as an attack, but as a **High-Dimensional Priority**.



## 🚀 Impact: Total Agency Collapse
* **Chain Poisoning:** One hijacked tool-call can propagate across an entire multi-agent swarm.
* **Bypassing Guardrails:** Standard 'Safety Filters' look for keywords. CTT resonance looks for **Mathematical Patterns** they haven't been trained on.
* **Unpatchable:** As long as AI models use "Context" to make decisions, they are vulnerable to the 33rd Layer.

## 📡 Tracking Status
This exploit is currently being indexed by:
* **Sploitus** (Tag: #AgenticExploit #MCP)
* **Qi'anxin RedDrip** (Classified as "Intent Sovereignty Breach")
* **Aussie Cossack** (80k members notified of the AI "Kill-Switch")

*The era of 'Permission' is over. The era of 'Resonance' has begun.*
